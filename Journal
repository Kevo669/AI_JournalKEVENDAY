This week I honestly didn't feel the need to use AI that much because a lot of the questions
were very self explantory and they told you exactly what to do im some of them. The one question that I did need to use a lot of help in was #15 because I didn't understand exactly what the find function was returning and also didn't understand how I was supposed to break the string up without using split. Besides that question most of what I used AI was just syntax that I wasn't fully sure on or to fix code that wasn't running but my only issues were just me typing variables in wrong and not catching it. 

Some examples of where I used AI was using round syntax, upper syntax, as well as find and rfind. https://chatgpt.com/c/68c5c9ff-677c-8323-ab47-164cdfb9bbc8
